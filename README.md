My name is Chelsea C. Ekwughalu. I’m a student/researcher of physics and computational neuroscience at Barnard College, Columbia University (Class of 2027). I'm working on modelling auditory omission mismatch negativity using a NetPyNE A1 model under the mentorship of S. Neymotin @ NKI. I previously analyzed human tms-eeg data with D. Sliva using MatLab (EEGLab). You can reach me  @chelseachiek on X, cce2136@barnard.edu, chelsea.ekwughalu@brown.edu, Chelsea_ekwughalu@rfmh.nki.org
